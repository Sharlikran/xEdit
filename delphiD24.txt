Compiling XEdit when you don't have a Delphi command line compiler to install the JCL and the JVCL (evaluation or starter versions).

If you have such a compiler, then install the JCL and the JVCL following the standard instructions, then proceed to installing VirtualTrees below.

Download working JCL/JVCL libraries for your delphi version. For 10.1 Berlin, you need the current master from GitHub of both libraries.
For previous versions, you can use the latest release of JVCL.

Download the Trunk-uploaded-FO4dump branch from TES5Edit github.

In Delphi:

Tools \ Options \ Environment variables
Add JCLBase pointing to the root of the JCL distribution (that is the jcl subdirectory in GIT or the jcl sub directory in the release)
Add JVCLBase pointing to the root of the JVCL distribution (that is the jvcl subdirectory in GIT or the jvcl sub directory in the release)

validate and close the options dialog

Tools \ Options \ Delphi Options \ Library

Library path: append the JCL and the JVCL:
  ;$(JCLBASE)\lib\d24\win32;$(JCLBASE)\source\include;$(JVCLBASE)\lib\d24\win32;$(JVCLBASE)\common;$(JVCLBASE)\resources

Browsing path: append the JCL and the JVCL:
  ;$(JCLBASE)\source\common;$(JCLBASE)\sources\windows;$(JCLBASE)\source\vcl;$(JVCLBASE)\common;$(JVCLBASE)\run

Debug DCU path: append the JCL and the JVCL:
  ;$(JVCLBASE)\lib\d24\win32\debug

validate and close the options dialog

Open the JCL installer JediInstaller.bdsproj from $(JCLBase)\install and compile it
Run the JCL installer JediInstaller.exe from $(JCLBase)\bin even though it will produce errors.
This will create jcld24win32.inc (for 10.1 Berlin)

Open the JCL groupproj from $(JCLBase)\Packages (the one for your version of Delphi). So JclPackagesD240.groupproj for 10.1 Berlin
Compile all.

Component \ Install Packages
Press Add, browse to $(BDSCOMMONDIR) which should be C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\18.0\Bpl and select all jcl*.bpl. 
Accept the errors (4 normally). Then in the list of installed packages remove the ones from JCL which aren't checked.

Close and restart Delphi.


Open the JVCL groupproj from $(JVCLBase)\Packages (the one for your version of Delphi). So D24 Packages.groupproj for 10.1 Berlin

MAKE SURE THE CHANGES TO Tools \ Options \ Delphi Options \ Library are still present. If not do it again. (I don't understand why it can disapear).

Compile all. The starter edition cannot compile the JvDB, both jvDBxx packages and jvDotNetxx packages cannot be compile. They are not used by xEdit.

Component \ Install Packages
Press Add, browse to $(BDSCOMMONDIR) which should be C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\18.0\Bpl and select all jv*.bpl. 
Accept the errors. Then in the list of installed packages remove the ones from JVCL which aren't checked.

Close and restart Delphi.

INSTALLING VIRTUAL TREES.

Replace VirtualTrees.pas with VirtualTrees.d24 in VirtualTrees\source.

Open the VirtualTrees groupproj from $(JVCLBase)\Packages (the one closer to your version of Delphi). So VirtualTreesD17PG.groupproj for 10.1 Berlin as there are no more recent one
Compile all.

Component \ Install Packages
Press Add, browse to $(BDSCOMMONDIR) which should be C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\18.0\Bpl and select VirtualTreesD17D.bpl. 

At this point, you can open the xEdit project files in Delphi and compile them.
On Berlin, use TES5EditD24.dproj for xEdit and FO4DumpD24.dproj for xDump

If you don't have the madExcept library, comment out the reference (TES5Edit.dpr line 21)
If you don't have the DevExpress component library, select the DebugLite build configuration in TES5Edit.exe
